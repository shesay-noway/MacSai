///
///   * **Root-owned children** under writable parents. `/Library/Caches/`
///     is writable, but `/Library/Caches/com.apple.InferenceProviderService/`
///     is mode 700 root:wheel — `unlink` from inside it returns EACCES.
///     Likewise `/private/var/log/com.apple.xpc.launchd/` (root-owned),
///     `/Library/Logs/PaloAltoNetworks/...` (third-party root daemons).
///
///   * **Data-vault dirs** in the user's own home. `~/Library/Caches/`
///     is owned by the user, but `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.containermanagerd/`,
///     `…com.apple.ap.adprivacyd/`, `…com.apple.Safari.SafeBrowsing/` carry
///     the `UF_DATAVAULT` flag — macOS rejects writes to these subtrees
///     regardless of FDA, regardless of ownership, regardless of root.
///     Only Apple-signed daemons can touch them.
///
/// Both surface as `access(W_OK)` denials at the syscall level (EACCES
/// for POSIX-permission denial, EPERM for data-vault denial), so a single
/// probe covers both.
