  caveats <<~EOS
    Mac Clean is open source and intentionally not notarized — we don't pay
    Apple's $99/year gatekeeping tax to ship free software.

    This cask automatically removes the quarantine flag during install, so the
    app should launch normally. If you ever see a Gatekeeper warning, run:

      sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Mac Clean.app"

    Some features (Mail, Safari, Privacy scans) require Full Disk Access:
      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access
