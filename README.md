## What is Mac Sai?

Mac Sai is a **free, open-source** macOS app that cleans junk files, removes malware, optimizes performance, uninstalls apps completely, and visualizes disk usage — all from a single, beautiful interface. It replicates every major feature of CleanMyMac while being fully transparent and community-driven.

**No subscriptions. No telemetry. No ads. Just a clean Mac.**

## Features

### Cleanup
| Module | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Smart Scan** | One-click scan combining cleanup, protection, and performance analysis with live progress across 13 modules |
| **System Junk** | 16 scan categories — user/system caches, logs, language files, broken preferences, broken login items, document versions, iOS backups, Xcode junk, **Universal Binary thinning** (detects fat Mach-O binaries with both arm64 and x86_64 slices and rewrites them to your native arch via `lipo`), deleted users, and more |
| **Mail Attachments** | Find cached attachments from Apple Mail, Outlook, and Spark |
| **Trash Bins** | Empty trash from all locations including external drives |

### Protection
| Module | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Malware Removal** | Signature-based scanning with 3 depths (Quick / Balanced / Deep), checks launch agents/daemons, browser extensions, and known malware patterns |
| **Privacy** | Clean Safari, Chrome, and Firefox data — history, cookies, cache. System traces cleanup with time filters |

### Performance
| Module | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Optimization** | Manage login items and launch agents with enable/disable toggles |
| **Maintenance** | 10 system tasks — free RAM, run maintenance scripts, repair permissions, rebuild Launch Services, reindex Spotlight, flush DNS, thin Time Machine snapshots. Tasks are tagged with severity (safe / disruptive) and "Run All" requires explicit confirmation; long-running tasks can be cancelled mid-flight |

### Applications
| Module | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Uninstaller** | 10-level app matching engine that finds every associated file across 17+ Library subdirectories. Complete removal, app reset, unused app detection |
| **Updater** | Check for available updates across installed apps via Sparkle appcast feeds |

### Files
| Module | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Space Lens** | Squarified treemap visualization of disk usage with drill-down navigation |
| **Large & Old Files** | Find files >50 MB sorted by size and last access date |
| **Duplicates** | Progressive detection — size grouping → partial SHA-256 (4KB) → full hash → inode verification |
| **Shredder** | Secure file erasure with standard, permanent, and secure overwrite modes |

### Menu Bar Widget

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/menu_bar.png" width="300" alt="Mac Sai menu bar widget" />
</p>

A glassmorphism menu bar widget that puts your Mac's vitals one click away — an independent process that launches at login and is toggled from the app's sidebar. No need to open the main window just to check in.

- **Live stat rings** — CPU load, memory pressure, disk usage, and battery in a 2×2 ring grid (`host_processor_info`, `vm_statistics64`, APFS capacity, IOKit power source), color-graded green → amber → red
- **Network, uptime & swap** — real-time up/down throughput, system uptime, and swap usage
- **Recommendations** — actionable, dismissible tips ("User caches grew to 2.52 GB — run System Junk") with one-tap actions, suppressed for 30 days once dismissed
- **Protection status** — last malware-scan time and threat count, color-coded by freshness
- **Connected devices** — external volumes (with free space) and external displays at a glance
- **Health alerts** — background notifications when disk runs critically low or memory pressure stays high (throttled, opt-in)
- **One click to the app** — jump straight into Mac Sai

## Architecture

```
Mac Sai
├── MacClean          — Main SwiftUI app (14 modules, 15 views)
├── MacCleanKit       — Shared framework (models, constants, protocols)
├── MacCleanHelper    — XPC privileged helper (LaunchDaemon for root ops)
└── MacCleanMenu      — Menu bar monitor (independent process)
```

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Language | Swift 6 with strict concurrency |
| UI | SwiftUI + AppKit hybrid |
| Concurrency | Actors, TaskGroup, async/await, @Sendable |
| Database | GRDB.swift (SQLite) with WAL mode |
| File Scanning | URLResourceKey prefetching on APFS |
| Incremental Updates | FSEvents with historical replay |
| Privileged Ops | SMAppService + NSXPCConnection |
| System Stats | Mach APIs (host_processor_info, vm_statistics64, proc_pidinfo) |

### Safety Model

Mac Sai is designed to **never cause data loss**:

- **Protected paths blocklist** — `/System`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, Apple system apps are untouchable
- **macOS firmlink canonicalization** — `/var`↔`/private/var`, `/tmp`↔`/private/tmp`, `/etc`↔`/private/etc` resolved to a single canonical form so symlink-redirect detection doesn't false-positive on legitimate system paths
- **Pre-scan cleanability filter** — items the current process couldn't trash (root-owned children of system caches, macOS data-vaulted dirs under `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.*`) are dropped at scan time so they never reach the UI as cleanable
- **Trash-first deletion** — all removals go to Trash by default
- **Dry-run mode** — preview what would be deleted without touching anything
- **TOCTOU prevention** — symlinks re-resolved immediately before deletion
- **Chunked cleanup** — large selections (50k+) prompt a confirmation modal; the engine splits the work into 5k-item chunks honoring `Task.isCancelled` between chunks so cancellation is responsive
- **Recursive byte accounting** — directory size is walked instead of stat'd, so the "X freed" count on the completion screen reflects reality
- **Orphan safety policy** — orphan cleanup restricted to caches/logs only
- **In-app activity log viewer** — every error during clean is logged with full path; the post-clean screen has a "View Log" button that opens an in-app sheet with errors-only filter and copy-to-clipboard so you can paste a bug report verbatim. Logs auto-prune after 30 days
- **Kernel-enforced XPC privilege gate** — the privileged helper uses `NSXPCListener.setCodeSigningRequirement` (macOS 13+) so the kernel itself rejects connections from any process whose code signature doesn't match the main app's identifier and team

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended — one command, no warnings)

```bash
brew tap iliyami/macsai
brew install --cask mac-sai
```

Mac Sai is notarized by Apple, so it launches from Spotlight or Applications with no warnings, no right-clicks, and no commands.

### One-line installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iliyami/MacSai/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest DMG and installs the app to `/Applications`.

### DMG download

Download the latest DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/iliyami/MacSai/releases/latest) and drag Mac Sai to your Applications folder. Mac Sai is notarized by Apple, so it launches normally with no Gatekeeper warning and no extra commands.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iliyami/MacSai.git
cd MacClean
swift build
swift test                     # run 486 tests
bash scripts/build-dmg.sh      # build local DMG (unsigned)
```

### Granting Full Disk Access

Some modules (Mail Attachments, Privacy, Malware) need Full Disk Access to scan protected areas:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access**
2. Click **+** and add **Mac Sai.app** from Applications
3. Restart Mac Sai

## Signed & notarized: why you can trust it

Mac Sai is code-signed with an Apple **Developer ID** and **notarized by Apple**. That matters more for a cleaning app than for almost anything else you install, because you are about to give it deep access to your files. You deserve to know that what runs on your Mac is genuinely ours and has not been tampered with.

Here is what that gives you, enforced by your own Mac and not just promised by us:

- **Apple has scanned it.** Every release is submitted to Apple and checked for malware before it ships. Notarization is Apple vouching that this exact build came back clean.
- **It cannot be tampered with.** The signature is a cryptographic seal over every file in the app. If a single byte changes after we sign it, whether from a corrupted download, a network attacker, or malware trying to ride on our name, macOS refuses to open it.
- **It is provably from us.** The signature is tied to our Apple Developer identity, so no one else can ship something your Mac will accept as Mac Sai.
- **It just works.** No Gatekeeper warnings, no right-click-to-open, no Terminal commands. Install it and launch it like any app you trust.

Put together with the fact that the entire source is open for you to read, this is a chain of trust you do not have to take on faith: the code is public, we sign every release, Apple verifies it, and your Mac re-checks that seal every single time you open the app.

Maintainers: see [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md) for how releases are built, signed, and notarized.

## Tests

```bash
swift test
```

XCTest-based suite covering:

- **`SafetyGuard`** — 24 adversarial tests (symlinks, traversal, NULL bytes, SIP, protected apps, file caps, idempotence)
- **`CleaningEngine`** — 9 integration tests (dry-run, trash, permanent, error handling, operation log)
- **`PlistJunkFilter`** — 9 tests including Apple-system-domain safety contract
- **`ScanCoordinator`** state machine — scan/cancel/category-filter/include-heavy
- **`TargetedScanner`** integration — runs against synthetic temp directory fixtures
- **All 16 system junk categories** — pure target declarations + the filter logic on the procedural ones (`BrokenPreferences`, `BrokenLoginItems`, `UniversalBinaries`, `DeletedUsers`)
- **`SquarifiedTreemap`** — empty, single, multi-node, area conservation, aspect-ratio properties
- **`AppMatching`** — all 10 levels of the uninstaller pattern engine
- **`DuplicateDetection`** — size groups, partial/full hash groups, inode dedup
- **`MalwareSignatures`** — name patterns + suspicious launch agent payloads
- **`MaintenanceTask`** — all 10 tasks have descriptions, icons, executable paths
- **`FileGroup`** — by-size / by-type / by-age grouping
- **`AppcastParser`** — Sparkle XML parsing
- **`VolumeInfo`** — usage math, equality
- **`AppDatabase`** — GRDB cache CRUD, migrations, invalidation
- **`FSEventMonitor`** — invalidated-path computation
- **`AppDiscovery`**, **`AppPathFinder`** — smoke tests
- **End-to-end** — synthetic fixture → scan → results → clean cycle

Test infrastructure (`Tests/MacCleanTestSupport/`) provides `withTempHome`, `withFakeApp`, `withFakePlist`, and other fixture helpers so tests stay deterministic and never touch the user's real home.

Coverage target: **85%+ overall**, **100% on `SafetyGuard` and `CleaningEngine`** (the death-and-life files). See [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md) for the full roadmap.

## Security

Mac Sai takes security seriously:

- **No network access** — the app never phones home, no telemetry, no analytics
- **No elevated privileges by default** — XPC helper only activated for maintenance tasks
- **Code signature verification** — XPC helper validates caller identity
- **Protected paths** — 27+ Apple system apps and all SIP-protected paths are blocklisted
- **Open source** — every line of code is auditable

### Security Audit Checklist

- [x] No command injection vectors (all Process args are hardcoded constants)
- [x] No arbitrary file deletion (SafetyGuard validates every path)
- [x] TOCTOU race condition prevention (symlink re-resolution before delete)
- [x] File operation caps (10,000 file limit per operation)
- [x] XPC caller validation (code signature check)
- [x] No secrets or credentials in source
- [x] Trash-first policy (recoverable by default)
- [x] Operation audit log (every action recorded)
